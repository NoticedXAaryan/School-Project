## Informatics Practices - Spending Analysis Tool

This is a project for my Informatics Practices (IP) subject for school, designed to collect, analyze, and visualize spending data for multiple individuals. Using Python, this program offers a user-friendly interface to log expenses, perform descriptive analytics, and generate visualizations such as bar charts and pie charts.

### Project Description

The Spending Analysis Tool allows users to:
- **Create new projects** where they can input spending data across various categories.
- **Load and analyze** existing data stored in CSV files.
- Perform **comparative analysis** across individuals.
- Generate **visual summaries** for individual and collective spending patterns.

### Features

1. **Data Collection**  
   Collects spending information across categories such as Food, Transport, Entertainment, Clothes, and Miscellaneous. Each person's spending is logged and saved to a CSV file for easy access and future analysis.

2. **Data Analysis**  
   Users can view descriptive statistics like total, average, minimum, and maximum spending, as well as identify categories with the highest and lowest spending.

3. **Data Visualization**  
   Offers options to visualize the spending data using:
   - Comparative bar graphs to see spending across multiple individuals.
   - Individual bar graphs for a person's spending by category.
   - Pie charts to show the breakdown of spending for each individual.
